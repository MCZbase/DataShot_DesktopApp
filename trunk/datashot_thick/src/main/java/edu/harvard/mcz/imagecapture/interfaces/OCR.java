/**
 * Interface for a class that can deliver a string from the result
 * of some Optical Character Recognition operation, and may throw an
 * exception as a result of that operation.  
 * <BR>
 * This interface doesn't include a defined setOCRSource method, as this might
 * be a method or a constructor providing one of a variety of sources, and is
 * thus left up to the implementation.  Compare how ConvertTesseractOCR is constructed
 * and is used as a wrapper for TesseractOCR to see why the OCR interface was
 * defined this way.
